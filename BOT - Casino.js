----------------------------------------

THE PLAYER: a player takes a sub as their stack and play using their clothes and restraints as chips.
THE SUB STACK: A sub that represent the amount chips available to the player. Each time they lose a chip the sub loses clothes or get restraints.

DOM: can only be a player, not a sub stack. Has no actual penalty.
SUB: as you can see subs are chained upon entering and the only way to leave is to get 5 wins. You can play either as a stack for someone else or as a player. In case you are a player you lose 2 chips for every win and also winning is harder. You must get a ` + (winTarget+1) + ` instead of a ` + winTarget + `.

HOW TO GET A SUB STACK: To get sub be your stack of chips you must find a willing sub and whisper me the command : !stack <name_of_the_sub>. The sub will need to accept.

GAME EXPLANATION: To start a game round whisper !start. When the game starts the dealer will ask who wants to play. If you accept you will bet one chip. Then a card is shown (value from 1 to 10). After that you can decide to bet 1 chip or fold. Then if someone is still playing a second card is draw. If the sum is ` + winTarget + ` or higher the player wins, otherwise they lose.

THE CHIP: The chip are actually sub clothes and restraints. Each time you lose/spend a chip your sub will lose a piece of clothing or get a restraint. There are 4 clothes and 4 restraints.

AFTER 5 WINS (SUB): You will receive the code of your locks and can leave (well someone still has to take the lock off). The number of your wins returns to 0 and now you can play like if you are a dom: you can get a stack and continue playing!
AFTER ` + domWinReward + ` WINS (DOM): You get a special reward. You will have to play to discover what it is.

------------------------------------------------

COMMANDS: all commands starts with !

!leave - You will be restrained with a mistress timer padklock (5 mins) and kicked out of the room.
!point - use this to check how many wins you have, how many chips and who is your domme/sub.

!start - [Dommes ONLY] start a new round
!play - [Dommes ONLY] when a new round starts you can play by using this command. You need to have a stack.
!no - [Dommes ONLY] you can use this command to say that you are not playing a round. This may help speed up the first phase.
!bet - [Dommes ONLY] after the first card is shown you can bet with this command
!fold - [Dommes ONLY] after the first card is shown you can fold with this command
!stack <name_of_the_sub> - [Dommes ONLY] use this to take a sub as your stack (dommes only)
!accept - [Subs ONLY] to accept a domme
!refuse - [Subs ONLY] to refuse a domme
